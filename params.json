{"tagline":"SeedOMatic makes it easy to create complex, repeatable seeded fixtures for your application.","body":"\r\nSeeds and db:fixture:load are great, but they're usually written in a way that they can only be used on an initial deploy. Seed-O-Matic gives you tools to specify seed data in a way that's repeatable across environments, allowing you to change seed data in a safe way between all of your environments.\r\n\r\n## Seed Files\r\nSeed files are set up as YAML files. By default, Seed-O-Matic will look for seed files in `config/seeds`, although you can\r\nspecify another directory when you run your seeds. Here's the structure of a typical seed file:\r\n\r\n    my_model:\r\n      match_on: code\r\n      tags: [initial_run, professional]\r\n      items:\r\n        - name: My Model 1\r\n          code: my_model\r\n        - name: My Model 2\r\n          code: my_model_2\r\n    other_model:\r\n      match_on: [code, category]\r\n      items:\r\n        - name: Other Model 1\r\n          code: om_1\r\n          category: a\r\n        - name: Other Model 2\r\n          code: om_2\r\n          category: b\r\n\r\n* The seed file starts with a *model name*. This should match the name of a model in your application.\r\n* The *items* array lists all the items you'd like to seed. Attribute names should match the name of your attributes.\r\n* You can specify a *match_on* attribute to prevent duplicate entries being created when seeds are run a second time.\r\n  Seed-O-Matic will try to find an entry which matches your match_on fields, and update if one is found. Multiple items work as well.\r\n* You can tag your seed files as well, if you want to import a subset of seeds in particular circumstances.\r\n\r\n## Running Seeds\r\n\r\nRunning seeds is as easy as calling:\r\n\r\n    SeedOMatic.run\r\n\r\nThis will look through the directory `config/seeds`, and import every file in that directory.\r\n\r\n### Importing specific directories, or specific files.\r\n\r\nTo load seed files from a specific directory, call:\r\n\r\n    SeedOMatic.run :dir => \"your/directory\"\r\n\r\nTo load a specific seed file, call:\r\n\r\n    SeedOMatic.run :file => 'config/seeds/my_model.yml'\r\n\r\n### Importing tags\r\n\r\nYou can load tags using the `tagged_with`, and `not_tagged_with` options:\r\n\r\n    SeedOMatic.run :tagged_with => 'my_tag'              # Will run all seeds tagged with my_tag\r\n    SeedOMatic.run :tagged_with => ['tag1', 'tag2']      # Will run if tagged with either tag1 or tag2\r\n    SeedOMatic.run :not_tagged_with => ['tag1', 'tag2']  # Will not run if either tag1 or tag2\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n* Referencing lookups from other seed files\r\n* Selective updating of data","note":"Don't delete this file!
